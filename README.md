# Frontend Problems

This is a set of challenges to help conduct technical interviews. It is not intended to assess the full skillset or competency of a developer, mostly to facilitate a discussion to understand the their thinking process as well as to see in which area of the frontend their strengths lie.

## 🏁 Running the project

The project uses Vite for a fast and convenient dev-server.

Run the following to get started.

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`

## 🤷🏻‍♂️ Problems

1. Why aren’t the games loading?
2. Why is there no border radius on the top of the cards and why is the offset circle cut off?
3. Can you walk me through `generics.ts` and explain the code?
